# It is separate from run_tests.sh because it needs a server: without one, this suite
# it SKIPS itself instead of failing, so `ctest` stays green on a machine
# with no mysqld.  Exit code 77 is the one CMake understands as
# "skipped".

# To set the environment up once:
#
#   sudo apt install -y mysql-server
#   sudo service mysql start
#   sudo mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE lux_tests CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;

#                  GRANT ALL ON lux_tests.* TO 'lux'@'127.0.0.1';
#                  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
#
#   tests/run_mysql.sh [path-to-binary]

# The credentials are written in on purpose: it is a test database
# recreated from scratch on every pass, just like the .db file of the
# sqlite.
