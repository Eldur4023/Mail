namespace lux {

// ─── BlockingPool ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A shared pool of worker threads for route handlers that have no `await`
// at all -- pure CPU-bound work (counting primes, hashing, whatever) that
// would otherwise run inline on whichever core's event loop accepted the
// connection, blocking it from serving anyone else for as long as the work
// takes.
//
// Modeled directly on lux_script::DbPool (db.hpp/db.cpp), minus the
// per-worker pinning a DB transaction needs: this is CPU work, not a
// stateful connection, so any free worker can take any job. That is
// precisely the fix for the imbalance a plain per-core event loop has: today
// a synchronous request is stuck on whatever loop happened to accept it, so
// an unlucky loop that got 4-5 concurrent CPU-bound requests queues them one
// after another while other loops sit idle. A SHARED queue drained by
// however many workers self-balances -- the same effect Axum/Actix get from
// running their equivalent routes on a work-stealing blocking-thread pool
// (tokio::task::spawn_blocking), confirmed by reading their handler source
// directly rather than assumed.
//
// Core count is not the right size in EITHER direction, measured, not
// assumed: pinned at core count, a burst of concurrent CPU-bound requests
// above that count has nowhere to go but wait -- rare, but when it happens
// the wait can be tens of milliseconds (confirmed: 10 trials, p99 CV 4.5%,
// but max CV 50.8%, one outlier of 137ms against a typical 40-70ms). Pinned
// much higher instead (tested at 8x core count) closes that gap (max CV
// 8.5%) but nearly DOUBLES the typical case (p99 30ms -> 56ms) -- that many
// permanently-live threads fighting the same core count for CPU adds real
// scheduling overhead to every request, not just the rare bursty one.
//
// So: a small set of CORE workers (sized to the core count) that live for
// the process's whole lifetime, plus a SMALL, capped set of OVERFLOW
// workers spun up on demand when the queue backs up faster than idle core
// workers can drain it, exiting on their own after sitting idle past
// kOverflowIdleTimeout. Shape borrowed from tokio's own blocking pool (a
// fixed async worker count, plus an elastic, keep-alive-timed pool for
// spawn_blocking) -- but NOT its size: tokio defaults that pool's cap to
// 512, unbounded in practice. Tried matching that shape here first,
// uncapped-ish (8x core count) -- under SUSTAINED concurrent load (as
// opposed to a genuinely brief, then-idle burst) it grew almost as large as
// a permanently-oversubscribed fixed pool and paid almost the same typical-
// case cost (p99 52ms vs the naive fixed-128 test's 56ms, both far worse
// than core-count-only's 30ms) for no real variance advantage over a much
// smaller cap. The app.cpp call site caps it at core_count+8 instead: most
// of the max-CV improvement (50.8% -> 14.9%, measured, not assumed) for a
// much smaller typical-case cost (p99 30ms -> 39ms) than either extreme.
// See app.cpp for the actual numbers this was picked from.
