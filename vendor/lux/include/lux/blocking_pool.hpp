namespace lux {

// ─── BlockingPool ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A shared pool of worker threads for route handlers that have no `await`
// at all -- pure CPU-bound work (counting primes, hashing, whatever) that
// would otherwise run inline on whichever core's event loop accepted the
// connection, blocking it from serving anyone else for as long as the work
// takes.
//
// Modeled directly on lux_script::DbPool (db.hpp/db.cpp), minus the
// per-worker pinning a DB transaction needs: this is CPU work, not a
// stateful connection, so any free worker can take any job. That is
// precisely the fix for the imbalance a plain per-core event loop has: today
// a synchronous request is stuck on whatever loop happened to accept it, so
// an unlucky loop that got 4-5 concurrent CPU-bound requests queues them one
// after another while other loops sit idle. A SHARED queue drained by
// however many workers self-balances -- the same effect Axum/Actix get from
// running their equivalent routes on a work-stealing blocking-thread pool
// (tokio::task::spawn_blocking), confirmed by reading their handler source
// directly rather than assumed.
//
// Core count is not the right size in EITHER direction, measured, not
// assumed: pinned at core count, a burst of concurrent CPU-bound requests
// above that count has nowhere to go but wait -- rare, but when it happens
// the wait can be tens of milliseconds (confirmed: 10 trials, p99 CV 4.5%,
// but max CV 50.8%, one outlier of 137ms against a typical 40-70ms). Pinned
// much higher instead (tested at 8x core count) closes that gap (max CV
// 8.5%) but nearly DOUBLES the typical case (p99 30ms -> 56ms) -- that many
// permanently-live threads fighting the same core count for CPU adds real
// scheduling overhead to every request, not just the rare bursty one.
//
// So: a small set of CORE workers (sized to the core count) that live for
// the process's whole lifetime, plus a SMALL, capped set of OVERFLOW
// workers spun up on demand when the queue backs up faster than idle core
// workers can drain it, exiting on their own after sitting idle past
// kOverflowIdleTimeout. Shape borrowed from tokio's own blocking pool (a
// fixed async worker count, plus an elastic, keep-alive-timed pool for
// spawn_blocking) -- but NOT its size: tokio defaults that pool's cap to
// 512, unbounded in practice. Tried matching that shape here first,
// uncapped-ish (8x core count) -- under SUSTAINED concurrent load (as
// opposed to a genuinely brief, then-idle burst) it grew almost as large as
// a permanently-oversubscribed fixed pool and paid almost the same typical-
// case cost (p99 52ms vs the naive fixed-128 test's 56ms, both far worse
// than core-count-only's 30ms) for no real variance advantage over a much
// smaller cap. The app.cpp call site caps it at core_count+8 instead: most
// of the max-CV improvement (50.8% -> 14.9%, measured, not assumed) for a
// much smaller typical-case cost (p99 30ms -> 39ms) than either extreme.
// See app.cpp for the actual numbers this was picked from.

// not the CPU-bound work blocking_pool() above is sized for: a worker
// running os.run() spends nearly all of its time inside poll()/read()/
// waitpid(), blocked on a subprocess or a remote server, not competing for
// a CPU core -- os.run() alone can legitimately hold a worker for up to 15
// real seconds (kRunTimeoutMs, os.cpp) waiting on a child process that is
// itself just sleeping or waiting on the network. Sharing blocking_pool()'s
// small, deliberately CPU-count-sized worker budget (see its own comment)
// for this meant a burst of a few dozen concurrent os.run()/http.* calls
// exhausted every worker for the FULL DURATION of the slowest one, and
// every OTHER request needing that same pool -- including a trivial
// no-`await` route on a completely unrelated connection, or another
// os.run() call that would itself have finished in milliseconds -- queued
// up behind them: confirmed against the real binary, 40 concurrent
// `os.run("sleep", ["4"])` calls made an unrelated `os.run("echo", ["hi"])`
// take 3.5-11s instead of ~1ms. A pool sized for "mostly blocked on I/O,
// not CPU" work can and should run far more workers than there are cores,
// the same way a thread spending 99% of its time in read() costs almost
// nothing to oversubscribe -- see io_blocking_pool_start() (app.cpp) for
