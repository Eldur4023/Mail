// it looks for is that no handler broke —a 5xx— after a change.

// On side effects: probing an endpoint RUNS its handler.  A DELETE or a POST
// would really do their work on every reload, so by default only the safe
// methods (GET and HEAD) are walked.  The rest come in with `--autotest=all`,
// which is a decision of whoever launches it and not of the binary.
